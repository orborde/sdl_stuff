	For some reason, I went and changed the SCREEN argument of all the SDL drawing commands to be at the end of the parameter list. No, I don't know why.
	Hmm...most stuff uses it at the beginning, so it should probably be there.
	The SDL API seems to put it at the beginning.
	So...
	BUGFIX: mousedl.c
		See above.

	Messed with SDL_drawfunc.c and cube3_brusher.c
	Trying to find the cause of the "vertical lines" color artifact
		Suppressed green and blue channels in drawGoodShadedTriangle
			in SDL_drawfunc.c to see the color patterns
			RESULT: Presence of the vertical lines artifact
			confirmed.
		Changed cube3_brusher.c to use drawSlowShadedTriangle
			RESULT: Saw something similar, except apparently
			along the lines that SlowShadedTriangle draws along
		Theory: There is a divide in the color calculations on the
			x-coord loop. This may be causing loss of precision

	cube3_brusher no longer dependant on protobrusher

	Added drawSlowGoodShadedTriangle, which is supposed to be the ultimate
		in smooth, pretty triangles, but exhibits the same weird jaggy
		stuff as drawGoodShadedTriangle...
