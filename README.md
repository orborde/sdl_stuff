cube - demonstrates linear transforms and rotations in 3D space, as well 
as framecounting and basic drawing functions.

cube2 - Another rotating cube. This one demonstrates bilinear 
interpolation to make some lovely colors. It also implements a prototype 
"brush" system that is used to process the polygons after rotation in 
order to determine whether they should be displayed and how to do it, 
abstracting the data for a "shaded triangle" into its own struct.

cube3 - cube2, except now it's controlled by the mouse (yes, it should 
be blank at first).

mousedl - an experiment to learn the SDL mouse interface

wicked-* - variants on an interesting graphics demo from an SDL tutorial
